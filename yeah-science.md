## Popular Science

Classic pop songs with science-y themes, and a few others things.

- She Blinded Me With Science - 
https://open.spotify.com/track/6HYf9ZEZKuxy581QVmYA6c?si=a7819c9cf29d4d47
- Weird Science - https://open.spotify.com/track/03AhYPRQeOqG2j54Tdg94E?si=a29caafe16e547a3
- Still Alive - https://open.spotify.com/track/5x7IgJwNwW8iKDzbIVugTx?si=728cf3f35bbf43dc
- Chemistry - https://open.spotify.com/track/6JZYxCV6Fu5edOZYeptlck?si=8d94aef2adb1458c
- Genetics - https://open.spotify.com/track/2FOwRoyI2TTujfAGmHgEJP?si=9224c6b66f0d4560
  - In case you are wondering: Yes, in fact Meghan Trainor's more famous "All About That Bass" **IS** calling out for a science parody leveraging a "bass"/"base" pun. Tim Blais (more about him later) made one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAJsZWhj6GI
- Bad Project (Lady Gaga Parody) - https://soundcloud.com/colin-schatz/zheng-lab-bad-project-lady-gaga-parody
  - Created by the members of the Hui Zheng lab at Baylor College of Medicine
  - The video is as over-the-top as you might imagine: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl4L4M8m4d0
- I Think I'm a Clone Now - https://open.spotify.com/track/28RVgcunbeqvKT13T5mmi1?si=91be04ff0d6e4fad
  - I wanted this playlist to have at least one Weird Al song, and I thought this was best aligned with synthetic biology. 

## A Little Bit Country, A Little Bit Science

- My Name Is Roscoe - https://soundcloud.com/colin-schatz/roscoe

  - This is from the British comedy show "The Adam and Joe Show", and really should be seen with its video for the full effect:<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_kzgW_OYX0<br />[CW: Several shots of the General Lee (the car) including the Confederate battle flag.]

- Stuck To You - https://open.spotify.com/track/6VvIHXPCA5F8IEpqoaxdPA?si=fd6a280f89cb405c

## Heliocentrism (Songs about the sun)

### Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy...

- Walkin' on the Sun - https://open.spotify.com/track/4TQeNHx85xcP9YRkvJC6K1?si=543ef7d734a64244

- The Future's So Bright - https://open.spotify.com/track/4EfZ2eaFjn1MQbKZD8urIz?si=e4ab0aa687a543f9

- Total Eclipse of the Heart - https://open.spotify.com/track/7wuJGgpTNzbUyn26IOY6rj?si=c683c50c37e94015
  - In flowchart form: http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4319553/tumblr_kojs29L9OU1qzd1jno1_r2_1280.jpg

- Why Does the Sun Shine? - https://open.spotify.com/track/1wfa3vAiIAbSxHbzKoSPuS?si=b8c578d51ba747fb
  - N.B.: Stricly speaking, the chorus lyrics here are inaccurate. The same album does include "Why Does The Sun **Really** Shine?", which explains the state of matter inside the sun is mostly plasma, but it's not as catchy.

## Learning Through Song

Possible alternative section name, except this fact isn't in any of the songs:

<img src="https://i.imgflip.com/662yx9.jpg" />

- First, a classic of this genre, Tom Lehrer's "The Elements". Written in 1959, it sets the names of chemical elements to "I Am A Model Of A Modern Major-General" from Gilbert & Sullivan's "The Pirates of Penzance", which premiered in 1879.<br />https://open.spotify.com/track/3LRGJ97WvYoD99lDgtcIFJ?si=2906af3879eb4b85
  - Per longstanding computer-science tradition, here's an extra layer of indirection: David Costabile,
    portraying Gale Boetticher in "Better Call Saul" (Season 4), as he both plays the classic Lehrer recording
    and sings along to it in his lab:
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2QjhOVKqpc 
  - Gilbert-and-Sullivan nerd side note: 
    This was the only Gilbert and Sullivan work to premiere in New York City rather than London,
    for reasons related to nuances of copyright law on either side of the Atlantic. Sullivan had sketched
    all the music for Penzance in England before sailing to New York, but when he arrived he discovered
    he had left all his work for Act I behind, so he had to reconstruct it from memory,
    in some cases composing new numbers entirely or adapting music he'd written for earlier works.
    The site of the hotel where he stayed while wording in this, at 45 East 20th Street,
    still bears a plaque commemorating the effort:<br />

- The Molecular Shape of You - https://open.spotify.com/track/5HXLA7Jfmtg4o85uRyerRh?si=665a14091e0242c0
  - This is from Canadian science communicator and parody-song creator extraordinare Tim Blais. 
    All of his songs are really best watched with the accompanying videos, on this Youtube channel:
    https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTev4RNBiu6lqtx8z1e87fQ
  - Here's the video for this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8FAJXPBdOg

- Entropy - https://open.spotify.com/track/16JOx3y99q2RrpDkId12pK?si=17086d4fb4c04360
  - Another Canadian entry, from Moxy Fr√ºvous, whose usual genre is described on Wikipedia as "satricial folk-pop"

- Soon May The Vaccine Come - https://open.spotify.com/track/0g4qa1kRuk4eJ6e4Z44USa?si=3fc0fdabf23a426a
  - Dedicated to those of you who are parents of children <5 and still waiting.
  - Tim Blais again. This is a cover of a 19th century New Zealand whaling ballad known as The Wellerman,
    which itself achieved viral popularity during sea-shanty trend of 2021 (#shantytok):
     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLiNQhQr4G4

- Big Bang Theory theme - https://open.spotify.com/track/5FCPN8g30PRH7lLgxDh9LQ?si=bc40fb3febc84167
  - I'm not sure what the prevalance of Canadians on this playlist means.

- Pi Pi Pi - https://soundcloud.com/colin-schatz/pipipi
  - I wanted to include at least one math song. Picking this was inspired by Sunil's turn-of-the-century boy-band selection at the R&D all-hands.
  - Video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvW5uqzHDAo 
  - Another math-y parody, arguably more apt for our work, dramatizes the Bayesian-vs-frequentist conflict - particularly cringey IMO, though perhaps that's a plus: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNz8mfFa7nc 

- Evo-Devo - https://open.spotify.com/track/574emiJLt2LD35Y99jUmOo?si=4839c6bec18748f7
  - Video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydqReeTV_vk

## Fermentation

### Isn't Amyris, in a sense, an extremely niche craft brewery? And aren't drinking songs, in a sense, about fermentation?

First in this section, the only thing I know of that could be considered an ode to *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*.
(If you know anything else, please let me know!)

- Biologist's St. Patrick's Day Song<br />https://soundcloud.com/colin-schatz/a-biologists-st-patricks-day-song
  - Video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oax3cUFsBSw

A couple other good drinking songs:

- Paddy Murphy - https://open.spotify.com/track/3693EM9EXKHpzD36Nzbjae?si=a36c34a30d1c4efc

- The Parting Glass - https://open.spotify.com/track/6ecR7hy1XTeS5lTFYOLVEV?si=ac178def52824da6
